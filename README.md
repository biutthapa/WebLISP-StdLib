# WebLISP Standard Library

The WebLISP standard library repository will contain modules and libraries that provide everything required to build games and high-performance applications (like Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Maya) that run smoothly on web-browsers.

## Modules
The library is organized into modules, each of which provides a specific set of functionality. The modules include:

- **math**: Provides a set of mathematical functions, such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and complex number operations.
- **string**: Provides a set of functions for working with strings, such as string manipulation and regular expressions.
- **list**: Provides a set of functions for working with lists, such as list manipulation, filtering, and mapping.
- **dict**: Provides a set of functions for working with dictionaries, such as key-value operations, merging, and filtering.
- **file**: Provides a set of functions for working with files, such as reading and writing files, directory operations, and file path manipulation.
- **network**: Provides a set of functions for working with network protocols, such as HTTP, WebSocket, and TCP.
- **graphics**: Provides a set of functions for working with graphics, such as drawing 2D or 3D shapes, loading and manipulating images, and applying visual effects.
- **audio**: Provides a set of functions for working with audio, such as loading and playing sound effects or music.
- **input**: Provides a set of functions for working with input devices, such as mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.
- **ui**: Provides a set of functions for creating user interfaces, such as buttons, text fields, or menus.

The standard library also includes utility functions for error handling, debugging, timing, and performance measurement.

## TODO
The following features are planned for implementation in the standard library:

- [ ] **physics**: Provides a set of functions for simulating physical objects, such as rigid bodies, joints, and collisions.
- [ ] **animation**: Provides a set of functions for creating and managing animations, such as keyframe animation or particle systems.
- [ ] **database**: Provides a set of functions for working with databases, such as SQLite or MongoDB.
- [ ] **serialization**: Provides a set of functions for serializing and deserializing data, such as JSON or XML.
- [ ] **security**: Provides a set of functions for securing communication and data, such as encryption or authentication.
- [ ] **machine learning**: Provides a set of functions for implementing machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks or decision trees.
- [ ] **parallelism**: Provides a set of functions for executing code in parallel, such as multi-threading or SIMD.
